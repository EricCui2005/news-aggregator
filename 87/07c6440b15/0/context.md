### Prompt 3

Question. Are you able/currently configured in this environment to search the internet?

### Prompt 4

Hello Claude. I am looking to build an AI-powered news aggregation web application. This application will simply be a wrapper over the Perplexity AI API. I would like you write me an implementation plan for such a project that includes the following specifications:
* I intend on deploying this project on Vercel, so I would like you to use Next.js as the web framework
* I would like to use a Perplexity API endpoint as the AI-powered heart of the application. I would like to use the "end-to-end" A...

### Prompt 5

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### Prompt 6

I would like to configure this local repository to push to the following remote: git@github.com:EricCui2005/news-aggregator.git. Please configure this remote and push

### Prompt 7

Amazing work so far. Can you now configure the textbox where the generation is outputted to render markdown?

### Prompt 8

Please do not automatically push to the repository after each change. I would now like you to create a separate "prompt" file where I can custom-write the prompt that will be sent to the Perplexity API.

### Prompt 9

I believe the response from the Perplexity API contains full links to the cited sources. Can you modify the application so that we can render clickable links in the generated text field?

### Prompt 10

### Prompt 11

I have an idea for how I want this application to look. I want some notion of a user profile. This user profile serves a couple purposes. Firstly, it allows you to securely store and load your API key. This user profile will additionally be associated with some user preferences. These user preferences will be used in the following use case. I envision an application that allows you define and save various topics and store them in identically-formatted "tabs". The idea is you can step into each t...

### Prompt 14

I am currently testing the application, and I am successfully directed to the OAuth page where I can sign in with a Google account. However, post sign in I am directed to a 404 page not found screen. What are some possible causes of this?

### Prompt 15

Please continue with Phase 3

### Prompt 17

I am trying to push the local changes I made to my remote repository, but I accidentally kept in the Perplexity API key secret that I have. Can you remove the key from the commit while keeping everything else and then commit everything? DO NOT PUSH TO THE REMOTE.

### Prompt 18

### Prompt 19

I am noticing a strange error in the project where when I switch tabs, the textbox does not update. For example, on a particular account I have two tabs - Web3, Hotdogs. When I enter the application I am initially in the Web3 tab. However, after clicking the hotdogs tab the textbox still says hotdogs. How do I address this.

### Prompt 20

Amazing, everything is working now. Now, more of a trivial request, but could you get rid of the profile photo component on the webpage next to the account name? There is currently no image being rendered, so I would just like to get rid of t

### Prompt 21

Amazing. Now, I would just like to modify the aesthetics of the application a little bit. I really like the minimalist concept you have going, but I would like you to spice it up a little bit as you see fit. Add some colors, choose an appropriate color pallet (I am thinking blue and black? I am a big fan of dark mode-style themes), and add some minimal and tasteful visual effects to the buttons. This is an aesthetic overhaul, so do not sacrifice function and do not attempt to add any more functi...

### Prompt 22

Could you create a minimal README.md that is appropriate for posting on a GitHub repository?

### Prompt 23

I want to deploy this as a live web application. I am thinking of deploying this via Vercel. I am confident in my ability to deploy it on their platform, I just want to know what GCP/Supabase configurations I need to change so that everything is hooked up properly.

### Prompt 24

### Prompt 27

The tool works really well. The only thing left for me honestly is being able to click on the links. Does the Perplexity API return the links of the sources it finds? If so, can you modify the code such that the links are clickable (right now in the markdown rendering tab, they are just numbers in brackets)

### Prompt 28

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation about building an AI-powered news aggregator:

**Initial Request (Message 1):**
- User wanted to build an AI-powered news aggregation web application
- Wrapper over Perplexity AI API
- Deploy on Vercel using Next.js
- Use "end-to-end" API with researched summary
- MVP: textbox + button, prompt like "What were the re...
